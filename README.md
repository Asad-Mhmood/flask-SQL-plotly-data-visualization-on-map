# Real Estate Data Visualization
## Streamlit+Plotly

This project about the data vizualiztion. I use Real Estate data of Pakistan for this. Using plotly represent the data points on map. And to make front end i use Streamlit which is use to make website.  

When user open the website. It ask for registration and after registration user can use it. Without registration it deny the access.  

For this registration and log in system I use SQL. After login home page will show to the user and user can access the services of the project.   

SQL,Flask,HTML,CSS,Plolty,Pandas are used in this project.
